# GameOfLife

Made in Visual Studio 2019.

Currently locked to a 20x20 grid. 

Due to an error on my part, irregularly sized grids such as 7x15 do not work as I made the mistake of thinking that array work as width then height.

Assumptions:
  - Since an infinite grid is unrealistic, the project has been implemented with a grid of 20x20 cells, the methods are in place to take custom grid sizes.
